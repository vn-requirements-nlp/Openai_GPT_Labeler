981,"The System must be able to retrieve and display within 5-8 seconds the case which has been accessed within the previous 2 months, regardless of storage capacity or number of cases in the system. This requirement is intended to allow for rapid retrieval of frequently-used cases, on the understanding that frequency of use is typically correlated with recent use.",,,,,,,,,,,,

991,The user interfaces of the system should comply with Standard ISO 9241.,,,,,,,,,,,,
992,The user interfaces should be designed to make them user intuitive;,,,,,,,,,,,,
993,"The System be scaleable and must not have any features which would preclude use in small or large police stations, with varying numbers of cases handled.",,,,,,,,,,,,
994,"Navigation links â€” particularly links representing the main navigation structure â€” should be labelled with terms that are familiar to the user, based on his/her general knowledge, prior experience in the application domain or experience of using other systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,
995,"Designing for input device independence: User interfaces should be designed to allow activation of controls by a variety of input devices. The ability to choose between different input devices for activating controls such as links, fields and buttons is important both for users who prefer a certain input mode, mobile users and users with disabilities. In general, device independence can be achieved if the functionality is operable via a keyboard.",,,,,,,,,,,,
996,"The target or purpose of a link should be directly indicated by its label, avoiding generic labels such as â€œgoâ€� or â€œclick hereâ€� except where the purpose of the link is clear from its context on the page or the labels have commonly understood semantics in the particular application domain. Using appropriate terminology specific to the userâ€™s tasks and information needs is important for making the content easy to understand.",,,,,,,,,,,,
997,"Navigation links should be clearly distinguishable from controls activating some action. Typical action types in user interfaces include manipulating application data, performing searches, communication actions, such as opening a new e-mail window or starting a chat function, and Hpresentation-related actions, such as sorting a list of search results.",,,,,,,,,,,,
998,"The System must be able to perform a simple search within 5-8 seconds and a advanced search (multiple search criteria) within 10-15 seconds regardless of the storage capacity or number of cases in the system. In this context, performing a search means returning a result list. It does not include retrieving the records themselves.",,,,,,,,,,,,

1006,"If user-specified profiles are used, users should be able to see, modify and delete that profile on demand.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1007,"If predefined user profiles or user-specified profiles are used for individualizing or adapting content, the profile currently used should be made evident. If profiles are used, it is important to provide users with information about this concept and its implications.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1008,It should be made evident to the user when individualization and/or adaptation are used.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1009,"When providing different access paths or navigation structures for different user groups, the tasks and information needs of these user groups should be taken into consideration.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1010,"Adapting the content and the navigation of a user interface to individual users or user groups can be a useful mechanism for providing information that is of interest to the users and for making access to relevant information more efficient. User adaptation can also be important for making the user interface more accessible. Different approaches can be used for achieving these goals, like providing users with means for customizing the user interface to their personal needs i.e. individualization designing content and navigation differently for varying user groups or roles i.e. such as employees of different levels, citizens etc, monitoring the userâ€™s behaviour and adapting to the userâ€™s goals that are inferred from the behaviour observed, recommending information that is potentially more relevant or interesting to the specific user, based on the behaviour of all users or a user group.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1011,Navigation components should be placed consistently on the pages or in the framesets in the pages of the application.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1012,"If navigation components (or overviews) are shown in conjunction with associated content, consistency between the navigation component and the content shown should be maintained by indicating in the navigation component (e.g. highlighting) the topic currently visible in the content area.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1013,A separate navigation overview such as a site map should be provided for application showing the structure of the site in an overview form.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1014,Linking back to the home page or landmark pages: Each page should contain a link leading to the home page of the application or to a landmark page that is easy to recognize for the user.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1015,"Observing principles of human perception When designing application pages, the general principles of human perception should be taken into account. The International Standards mentioned below shall be consulted for guidance. Practical guidelines for presenting information to the user are to be found in ISO 9241-12. Guidance on selecting and using different forms of interaction techniques is to be found in ISO 9241-14 to ISO 9241-17. ISO 9241-14 gives guidance about menus, ISO 9241-15 about command dialogues, ISO 9241-16 about direct manipulation and ISO 9241-17 about forms. In addition, when designing multimedia information presentations, the design principles and recommendations described in ISO 14915-1 to ISO 14915-3 should be taken into account. Appropriate content presentation also plays a key role in accessibility.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1016,Placing title information consistently: Page titles should be placed in a consistent location on the different pages.,,,,,,,,,,,,

1767,"Systems supporting OM should have the ability to classify entities associated with the investigation as investigation controls. For example, controls share demographic characteristics with the subject of the case, but are not infected with the agent that is the focus of the investigation.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1768,"Both the jurisdiction investigating the event and the jurisdiction reporting the cases and associated investigations must be captured. For example, if a person becomes ill during travel in one jurisdiction but is the resident of another, the illness will be reported by the state (jurisdiction) of residence and investigated by the jurisdiction visited.",,,,,,,,,,,,

1824,The administrator shall be able to add custom structure lists.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1825,A standalone database engine will continue to be necessary. Performance objectives for the standalone database should be comparable.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1826,"Some of these factors may make it impossible to achieve the performance requirements for Pontis 5.0 outlined in this section. However, based on our assessment of the existing condition of most agency systems and infrastructure, we think this outcome is unlikely.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1827,"There are selected licensees, typically smaller agencies, who may have much lower powered computer resources, and their performance must be acceptable as well, although not necessarily comparable to larger installations.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1828,"This section presents speed targets for specific system functions. The apparent speed of many operations will be affected by network latency (delays due to transmission of text and images from the Pontis application server to the client desktop machine and web browser, or for standalone operations). The times indicated in the table represent user-experienced response times.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1829,"The target times indicated in the table represent 90% thresholds â€“ that is, the performance requirement specified here means that the indicated functions will take less than the indicated length of time an average of 9 out of 10 times.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1830,"Pontis 5.0 is not strictly a transactional application or mission-critical for most capabilities. In light of this, the application shall be available for use 18 hours per day, 353 days per year, reserving 6 hours per day and one day per month for routine agency network and infrastructure maintenance. During normal times of operation, Pontis shall achieve 98 percent up time.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1831,"Because Pontis 5.0 is not a mission-critical application, there will be no attempt to design or construct the system for uninterrupted operation. Agencies may choose to implement database transaction logging, mirroring, or switchover to backup servers in the event of a hardware or network failure, but support for these decisions or implementation are beyond the scope of Pontis 5.0 effort. Procedures and equipment for backups (database and software) and disaster recovery are also outside the scope of this effort.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1832,"The Pontis application server (ASP.NET) software will run on a server located within a (presumably) secure facility at each agency. Because it is an ASP.NET application, the end users can vary in location depending on the network accessibility of the server. The Pontis database, and any other databases to be accessed from Pontis may be co-located on the same server machine, but at a minimum must be accessible from the Pontis application server via standard database communication and connection protocols.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1833,"The server machine will run Windows Server 2003 or, given technology evolution, a descendant target server environment identified in the implementation plan. The server machine must have all necessary software to run an ASP.NET application. This specifically includes, but may not be limited to, IIS30, the .NET Framework and ASP.NET. Other web servers, appliances, and add-in technologies may also be necessary depending on the final application design.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1834,The effective speed and congestion levels on the network that connects the servers and client machines running the application; and,,,,,,,,,,,,
1835,"Back-end server stored procedures and server-side functions will be supported and may be assumed to be usable in the technical design of Pontis 5.0. This will require implementation of the triggers in native DBMS procedural code. This implies that it is very likely that the server-side code will vary for each target DBMS, even if the interfaces remain identical, increasing the development and testing effort with the significant benefit of assigning processing to the appropriate application tier(s).",,,,,,,,,,,,
1836,"Standalone capabilities will require a workstation running the latest .NET Framework, presumably Windows XP Professional (SP2) or its successor. Some capabilities may require a network connection. The workstationâ€™s hardware requirements will be similar to those of the existing Pontis 4.4 application. There will continue to be a standalone/runtime database engine provided with the application for offline work. The offline database is assumed to be Sybase Adaptive Server Anywhere release 9 or above.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1837,Pontis 5.0 security is a mix of database security and application security. Overall security is provided by the database and the Pontis 5.0 user authentication mechanisms with more refined security over program capabilities - e.g. create a bridge - being addressed by the application.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1838,"It is assumed that authentication will utilize a single sign-on (SSO) approach and application security will be declaratively managed through database or directory entries, rather than hard-wired into the application. This mechanism may have implications for BRIDGEWare/AASHTOWare generally and will need to be coordinated with the other AASHTO products31.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1839,"Database security will need to be insured for the Pontis data stored in the RDBMS; most likely this will be done by using a specific username/password combination and running as particular database roles for each database connection. This security structure should be similar to the existing security approach in Pontis 4.x. For web clients, care will be taken to insure that connection information is not accessible from application pages (e.g., userid/password embedded in HTML form variables).",,,,,,,,,,,,
1840,"The application level security controls will be consistent with current Pontis 4.x procedures, except more comprehensive; no exceptional controls are required. A specific requirement addresses field-level data security.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1841,"For normal users, the configurability of the system via the interface will be limited to changing the parameters used to perform the various analyses and modeling functions. Access to all other configuration parameters, such as module access, will be restricted to Pontis super users or application administrators.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1842,There are no specific privacy or immunity (antivirus) requirements for Pontis 5.0 identified at this time.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1843,The system shall be capable of exporting the NBI data in the specified NBI format as outlined in the NBI guideline. The system shall be capable supporting the future NBI coding guide changes.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1844,The system shall provide data review wizard for comparing incoming bridge data with existing data. The errors will be highlighted for easy review.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1845,"Pontis 5.0 will be designed to be used with Internet Explorer; it may work correctly with other browsers but this cannot be guaranteed. Given the predominance of IE in the browser market, it does not appear to be necessary to consider support for other browsers, although this may need to be reconsidered if external customers are running the application(s) and need to employ different browser technology such as Netscape or Mozilla FireFox.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1846,"The administrator shall be able to configure definitions of element types, environments, materials, and categories.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1847,"The speed of the servers on which Pontis, the RDBMS, the analytical and other processing engines, and other information resources are installed;",,,,,,,,,,,,
1848,"Integrating DataWindow .NET is likely a short-term strategy to ease migration of user forms and reports to Pontis 5.0. A stated objective for Pontis 5.0 is eliminating dependency on PowerBuilder. Ideally, the application should not require any particular vendor technology for report or form generation, such as InfoMaker/PowerBuilder, so a sunset plan must be developed to outline a strategy to meet this objective. However, the application shall continue to provide a plug-in capability to integrate third-party .NET data displays and reports in the user workspace.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1849,The administrator shall be able to add custom project lists.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1850,The administrator shall be able to configure default values for various scenario parameters.,,,,,,,,,,,,

1854,The administrator shall be able to configure the labels of user interface items and screen displays.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1855,The system shall be capable of supporting internationalization using the standard Windows/.NET internationalization support.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1856,"The system shall be capable of showing all screens, menus, user interface controls, prompts, error messages and information notices in native language, with some of these elements customizable.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1857,The system shall provide an interface to communicate with an external service or third-party software. A set of standard interfaces25 will be defined for this capability.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1858,The capacity and speed of the commercial RDBMS product used for the data repository;,,,,,,,,,,,,
1859,The system shall provide application administrators with a secured tool for overriding bridge/project check-out status.,,,,,,,,,,,,
1860,"The system shall provide a fixed set of predefined, secured, administration reports to document users, user roles, application privileges, user login sessions, checked-out bridges, and other key information necessary to manage application operation.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1861,"The EIM&DSS design will be informed by World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) design guidelines26 and conform to common industry practices for user interaction behavior and user interface design. For the thin-client portion of Pontis, the AASHTO standards for thin-client web-based applications software will be followed.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1862,"The software, through its user interface, will clearly identify the product name (Pontis 5.0.x), the licensee, the connected user, and the organization that developed the system (AASHTO). Additional session identification information will be available on demand.27 The overall look and feel of the product will be that of a professional and conservative application.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1863,"Pontis 5.0 will, at AASHTOâ€™s direction, adopt any elements of the look and feel of other existing AASHTOWare/BRIDGEWare applications where appropriate. In particular, UI conventions from Virtis/Opis will be reviewed to ensure that the Pontis 5.0 does not differ markedly in appearance. AASHTO may designate such model applications and must provide the development team with access to fully-documented style sheets/UI layouts or demonstration software to support this requirement.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1864,There will be no support for individual personalization of the user interface (skins) other than the availability of certain features that are tied to a user role (e.g. not all users will have the ability to edit bridge data and thus will not see an â€œEdit Onâ€� button on the corresponding screen).,,,,,,,,,,,,
1865,"Pontis 5.0 will be designed to be as straightforward and intuitive as possible, and familiar to existing users. The user interface will provide effective navigation, visual referencing, and task sequencing. Users will have access to on-line help throughout the UI.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1866,"The application should look and feel consistent in the web and standalone operating environments, therefore it will conform to standard .NET standalone and web application conventions with necessary accommodations for the deployment environment only where these prove necessary and appropriate.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1867,"As a general goal, Pontis users should be comfortable operating and using the software after two full days of training. Users who only wish to access and display bridge information should be comfortable operating and using the software after two hours of training. System administrators should be comfortable operating and maintaining the software after user training and one full day of system administration training.",,,,,,,,,,,,
1868,"The system developer shall consider supporting existing custom forms and reports developed in PowerBuilder 9. It shall decide on a development tool for users so that they can continue to customize Pontis and extend its capability. For example, custom forms and reports created with PowerBuilder 9 may be migrated to a .NET application by using the Sybase DataWindow .NET technology which is available in PowerBuilder 10.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Course administrators can also track how they have changed a score over time using the timestamps associated with each change to the gradebook.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2594,The system should maintain a grade history.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2595,"The system should display grade information such as the grade for each assignment, averages, and overall grade to the actor to whom the grades belong. No other actor should be able to view anotherâ€™s grades except an actor in the role of course administrator for the course to which the grades belong.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2596,Course administrators should be able to post grades for an assignment based on the ratio of points earned to points possible. The course administrator should also be able to attach feedback in the form of text or an attachment (as described above). Time stamps should be attached to the last time the grade was modified so that actors may examine when particular grades were submitted and how an actor in the role of student has improved or lessened his performance in the course.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2597,"For this requirement, page refers to any distinct page (e.g., an assignment, a wiki page, a forum post, etc.). When a page is created, the actor in the role of course administrator should be able to toggle whether notifications are turned on. By default, they should be turned on for announcements. If notifications are turned off, actors in the capacity of student should be able to subscribe to notifications.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2598,"The social, collaborative components of Moodle are not very robust. There are better, freelyavailable solutions which should be integrated into Moodle to provide the best functionality possible for all actors without having to use 3rd party services.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2599,"Students should be able to select in their preferences whether notifications are sent to their mobile telephone (via SMS) or e-mail account. They should also be able to manage their notification subscriptions (for example, remove themselves from notifications).",,,,,,,,,,,,
2600,"A system will be considered to meet this requirement if it has a single administrative interface rather than individual links for editing each page. Furthermore, this interface must allow administrators to easily change themes and other setting that affect page layout across the entire courseware system.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2601,"Back-up requirements will need to be determined, based on individual components of the system. The system should be backed up with a frequency that ensures system and course data is protected. Since assignments will be submitted via the system, it should be backed up on a nightly basis, with options for weekly, off-site backup when necessary.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2602,The system must have the ability and capacity to restore back-up data within six hours so that the system is never offline for an inordinate period of time.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2603,"The system should be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2604,"This statement provides a general sense of system availability. It is not intended to demand the system maintain reliability, or to require the system to be highly available. It should not exclude maintenance windows, or scheduled downtime. It is only intended to convey the expectation that our customers should have access to the system during off-hours as well as business hours. 99% up-time should be considered sufficient to meet this requirement.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2605,Users must have easy access to help while interacting with the system. Adequate user documentation should be provided to minimize the number of calls to the Help Desk about problems with the system. Modifications should be reported via the main page to inform actors of unexpected changes. This electronic documentation should be supplemented with phone and on-site support provided by the Office of Information Services.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2606,"System administrators must have access to comprehensive, searchable documentation.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2607,A comprehensive database of maintenance tasks and help files should be compiled to make the courseware system easier to maintain from an IT staff point-of-view. Search results should be displayed based on relevance.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2608,"This documentation must cover all procedures necessary for regular maintenance with links to additional information, all common errors, and links or documentation for advanced troubleshooting.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2609,The system must be maintainable without substantial modification.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2610,"Due to limited staff in the Office of Information Services, it is important that the system be mostly self-sustaining. This will reduce the number of FTE hours spent maintaining the system and simplify maintenance tasks.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2611,"Although any courseware solution may be composed of diverse systems, applications, and processes, the underlying architecture should be transparent to the administrators. The system should be configurable from a single source at a central administrative position, and should provide a central, easy-to-use interface that will allow administrators to configure the user interface and features in a way that reduces page clutter.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2612,The system should support at least 1000 concurrent users.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2613,"This statement provides a general sense of reliability when the system is under load. It is important that a substantial number of actors be able to access the system at the same time, since a courseware system is important to the courses that employ it. The times when the system will be under the most stress are likely during midterm and finals weeks. Therefore, it must be able to handle at least 1,000 concurrent users.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2614,The system must be backed up on a configurable schedule.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2615,The system must allow actors in the capacity of course administrator to post grades associated with assignments for a particular actor in the capacity of student. Actors in the role of professor may want to optionally grade assignments online since they are being submitted electronically by actors in the role of student.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2616,A course administrator must be able to grade an assignment.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2617,The system must display a search box on every page after an actor has logged in.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2618,"Actors should be able to search from any page. If the actor is hierarchically outside of a particular course, each of his or her courses should be searched and results should be grouped by course. If the actor is hierarchically inside of a course, that course should be searched with an option to search all courses.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2619,"One of the fundamental tasks of the system is to allow actors to upload and manage files on certain pages of the system. These might include assignment submission pages, forum pages, wiki pages, and announcement pages. An actor in the role of course administrator should be able to optionally upload multiple files where he or she finds that such as feature would be usefulâ€”such as on a devoted project page.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2620,"For this requirement, page refers to any distinct upload point (e.g., an assignment, a wiki page, a forum post, etc.).",,,,,,,,,,,,
2621,The system must allow for multiple file upload to be configured on a per-page basis.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2622,"Actors in the capacity of course administrator or professor should be able to enable multiple file uploads on a page of his or her choosing. For collaborative projects, it becomes important for actors to be able to upload more than one file to a given page, especially in the case of an assignment submission where the assignment might include multiple parts. Such a construct should be offered to the actor during a pageâ€™s creation and editing stages.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2623,The system must be able to capture and organize voice clips that can be used where appropriate.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2624,One of the shortcomings of the current courseware system is that the foreign language department is unable to capture and track voice clipsâ€”recorded by studentsâ€”for oral homework over the course of a studentâ€™s education.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2625,The system must allow actors to organize their voice clips into a portfolio.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2626,"Equal and finite drive space needs to be allotted to each actor in the role of professor or administrator to allow for the storing of voice clips recorded and submitted by all actors in the roles of students. Actors in the role of professor or system administrator should be allowed to partition this space for actors in the roles of students. This can be done one of two ways: 1) the actor can be allowed to preview the voice clip before it is archived and determine whether or not he or she would like that clip to be archived, or 2) a newly created voice clip can be automatically archived. The first option would allow the actor to throw out an audio clip that is deemed to be unsuitable or inappropriate for an assignment without having to take it out of an archive of voice clips. The actor should have the option to have the voice clip be archived after a preview has taken place. The second option would automatically archive a voice clip once submitted but would require that the actor interact with the archived file. Thus, if the actor chooses to delete the file, it would need to be deleted from the archive of voice clips.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2627,Maintaining an archive of voice clips makes it possible for comparisons to be made between clips to determine whether an actor is improving his or her language skills over multiple courses. The actor should be able to optionally attach one of his or her archived items to any page where uploads are permitted.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2628,The term archive used above may also be referred to as a portfolio.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2629,The system must allow actors to download their voice clips in a flexible format.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2630,"Voice clips should be optionally downloadable in a format such as MPEG Audio (mp3) format, since it is widely supported across different web browsers and operating systems. Voice clips should be downloadable for archival purposes or for the purpose of presenting them to other actors.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2631,The system must store audio clips in a format conducive to speech.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2632,The system must be able to capture and manage files where appropriate.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2633,The system must allow actors to delete recorded clips.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2634,"In addition, the search page described above might allow for the possibility of searching the world wide web using a standard search engine such as Google.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2635,"Second, a single page should be dedicated specifically to the task of searching the course management system. In addition to the basic search field, this page should allow an actor to filter out certain results (such as forum posts or grades, etc.) and search specific sections (or components) of the course management system. Results should appear in categories (e.g., Assignments, Wiki Pages, Forum Posts, etc.) based on relevance. In this case, relevance is determined by results that having the highest number terms matching the search terms. When the actor clicks a search result link, they should be taken to the page corresponding to the search result.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2636,"First, it should be present in the form of a search box and a â€œSearchâ€� button on the top or bottom of every page. More information on this topic is given in sub-section 3.4.2 below.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2637,"Actors should be able to search for pages at the course level, since most actors will be searching for material in a given course. The search feature should be present in two ways.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2638,Voice clips should be stored in a format optimized for speech since this feature is meant to catalog voice recordings. Recordings should only be converted to MPEG Audio (mp3) format when they are being downloaded; a separate viewer should be provided in a cross-platform language for listening to clips in Moodle.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2639,"Moodle can be difficult to navigate and requires too many clicks to be efficiently used. Too many steps to complete basic actionsâ€”such as submitting an assignmentâ€”lead to frustration on the part of the actor. A search utility enables actors to find what they are looking for quickly in addition to having a hierarchical approach to finding functions of the course management system. For this requirement, page refers to any distinct page, such as an assignment, a wiki page, or a forum post.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2640,An actor must be able to search through pages in a course.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2641,"Actors in the course administrator role may not feel the need to provide web feeds for every page in their course. During the creation and editing of a page, that actor should be able to toggle web feed availability.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2642,The system must allow web feeds to be turned on or off on a per-page basis.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2643,"If actors are unable to be notified in some way of new content in Moodle, they are unable to efficiently keep track of a courseâ€™s current affairs. For this requirement, page refers to any distinct block (e.g., assignments, wikis, forum threads, etc.).",,,,,,,,,,,,
2644,"The system must be able to display web feeds, such as RSS 2.0 feeds, for all pages of the course management system where elements such as forum posts, assignment postings, announcements, wiki alterations and other blocks of information that an actor may view are added. Actors in the role of course administrators should have the ability to determine which of these components have feeds and to whom these feeds should pertain.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2645,"Since voice clips should be stored in a portfolio for each actor during his or her existence in the course management system, he or she should be able to examine his or her portfolio to select and delete clips if he or she chooses to. This allows him or her to manage archived voice clips and to create a cohesive portfolio that actors in the role of professor can use to judge improvement over time.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2646,The system must be able to use search functionality as a way to navigate Moodle pages instead of using hierarchical links.,,,,,,,,,,,,
2647,"The external users need to be able to click on an area and obtain data for the surrounding area, such as lapsed quantities, historical use, and adjacent permits. Need to support decision-making on the applicant s part, especially when their request does not meet the MFL requirements.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2648,"Make the following property appraiser data available so you can improve the ability to project service area populations in inter-Census years in several ways: Provide a more discreet and up-to-date count of housing units in a utility service area, Help determine when a DRI is completed, Match commercial properties by the connection data provided by utilities, Use lot sizes, where available, to determine its role in household water use compared to other variables in research projects, There may be other data of use as well (wells, pools, etc).",,,,,,,,,,,,

2661,Report compliance on a permit (not wells). Crop reports on permits (not wells) (I think this was a requirement to report this data some how at a well level).,,,,,,,,,,,,
2662,"Capture crop report data and link it with the corresponding use quantities, so you can observe changing crop patterns, see where land has shifted out of crops, and track water use per planted acre per crop to see patterns in water use by geography. The accumulation (or depletion) of credits by geographic area could point out potential problems in permitting in specific geographic areas. It may point to soil type or local cultural practice problems. Link to requirement JY4/SR7, the report of water credits used and earned.",,,,,,,,,,,,
2663,"Need tool to be able to estimate water use (now being done in SAS). To do this estimate, you need to be able to query the water use data with various variables, such as time period, use types, withdrawal type (groundwater or surfacewater), and geographic areas. Once the initial query is complete, you need to be able to refine the resulting data set. An example is when you select active permits in a time period. If a permit expired inside of the time period, the refine tool would help determine if that permit would or would not be a part of the result set, perhaps by determining at what point in the time line it expired.",,,,,,,,,,,,
